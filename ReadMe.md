To test these out a person can do one of the following:
1. have index.html and then run the js code in browser
2. install node and then run the js file in terminal
3. find online websites that do have js support and then run the code there
    for example:
        1. https://repl.it/languages/babel
        
Rules of Big-O Notation:
The goal of algorithum analysis is to understand the algorithm's efficiency by calculating f(n). However, it can be challenging to calculate f(n). Big-O notation provides some fundamental rules that help developres compute for f(n).

1. Coefficient rules
2. Sum rules
3. product rule
4. polynomial rule
